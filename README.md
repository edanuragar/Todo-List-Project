### To-do Web Page
*There is a screen with things to do. At the top of the screen, a search is made to see if the item you want to search for is in the to-do list. 
A warning appears on the screen indicating whether it is present or not. Additionally, a new to-do item is written at the bottom of the page and added to the list with a button. 
There are checkboxes and delete buttons next to each to-do item. The item can be deleted with the Delete button. 
If the checkbox button is checked, it means that the item is completed and the item will be crossed out automatically.*
